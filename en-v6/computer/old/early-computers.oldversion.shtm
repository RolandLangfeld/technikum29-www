    <p>Early computers are really worth seeing because of their enormousness and the very nice transparent accessory devices.
    <br />There is a very important computer family that lead to the todays (home) computers: The development of the "Mini"-computers (mini compared to the common big mainframe computers at that time) from Digital Equipment Coroperation (DEC), series PDP 8. The museum has a complete production run from that devices: From the PDP 8 (also called Classic-8), year of manufacture 1965 to the PDP 8a (1975). The PDP 8a is less important so it is located in the archive.</p>
    <!--The legendary Classic PDP 8 from the company DEC (year of manufacture 1965) can be admired among others. Furthermore you can see the PDP 8L or <a class="go" href="/en/devices/pdp_8I.shtm">PDP 8I</a> (year of manufacture 1967, a lot of periphery) and the laboratory computer <a class="go" href="/en/devices/lab_8e.shtm">LAB8e</a> (1971).
    Because of constantly growing claims for storage capacity, backing storage (19-zoll drawers for 4kB with a weight of 20kg) was offered. The PDP 8I could not administrate more than 32kB.
    <br />THe PDP 8L, a trimmed-down version of the PDP 8I, cannot hold more than 8 kB.</p> -->

: The <b>Classic PDP 8</b> from DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation, Massachusetts):
         He is considered to be the world's first mass-produced "minicomputer" (1965). "Mini" is relative: Only too very
         strong men can lift the computer. It is better to have four people to carry it!.
         Without ICs or their ancestors the device is counted among the seccond-generation calculators.
         <br>You can also get a view from the "Flip-Chip"-card from the <a class="go" href="/en/devices/pdp-8-left-flank.shtm">left flank</a> (<u>flank</u>). The core memory is set above (storage capacity 4kB).

        <div class="bildtext"><b>PDP 8L</b>-installation with a lot of periphery. Year of manufacture 1968, partly with ICs of the TTL-series, partly plain transistor technology (<u>Transistortechnik</u>).
        <br>The computer is 2 meter high and constists of a DIN A2 <u>drum plotter</u> (Calcomp 563, on the top), two TU 55 drives for magnetic tapes, a fast optical paper tape reader, the CPU and two expanded memories.
        On the left you see the famous TELETYPE ASR 33 as a printer (with mechanical paper tape reader/-puncher)</div>

    <p>Furthermore the first system that looks like a today's computer is connected: <a class="go" href="/de/geraete/wang2200.shtm">WANG 2200</a>, year of manufacture 1973. The computer with so much peripheral devices is propably unique in Germany. For example paper tape reader, <u>Staplekartenleser</u>, 8-zoll triple disc drive, disc system (<u>Plattensystem</u>) with 38cm big disks (the device has a weight of 100kg and costed 24.000,- DM whereas it only saved 5MB), special Basic-keybard, etc.
    <br>The first personal computer was also build by WANG: PCS II (1975). The first PC that was affordable for everyman came on the market in 1977: PET 2001 from Commodore. It was as cheap as a today's PC but saved 8kB and had decent applications. More Homepcomputer followed, the market got out of hand and therewith the collection of computers ends. <a class="go" href="/en/details2.shtm" title="Details 2">See also details 2</a></p>
