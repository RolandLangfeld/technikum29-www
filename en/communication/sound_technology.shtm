    <p>It was a long way with many quaint and interesting variants until the today's CD. Trumpet gramophone, tape recorders in its history of development, (among others AEG, 39kg heavy full-track technology from 1938), Optaphon, the first mechanically controlled autoreserve (1952) until professional tape recorders from 1960 are shown. Futhermore: Wire recorders, automatical answering machines (1954), devices with "gramophone bands" where the sound was not saved magnetically but like on gramophone records (Tefifon) and many more.
    <br/>On this page, we have chosen one of the three dictaphones from the early office technology.</p>

    <p>Only the drive was electrical. The sonic oscillations were conducted through a mouthpiece and an hose made of metal and scored in the rotating disc with a kind of graver. The disc could be played back with an horn (left side of the picture) or with earphones that were connected with hoses to the pickup (left side). Of course the quality was cruel.</p>

        <p class="bildtext-bildbreite" style="width: 546px;">A radio reporter in 1951 had to be a strong guy to carry the Ferrophon around. This semi-professional tape recorder of Loewe Opta Radio AG Type "Ferrophon IIIc/3" was hardly affordable for the non-commercial user. The replay quality is excellent (max. tape speed of 76cm/sec!) and likewise the used components (a lot of copper parts) which was rare in the early past war years.
        Including a match box in the picture helps to visualize the physical size of this recorder combination. </p>

            <p>This device uses wires as sound storage media. Thus an hour of music fits into the small coil shown on the right side of device. This is the advantage of using steel wire: It doesn't need much space. The quality of sound was quite suitable, but the flimsy wire was always in danger of tear apart.
            <br/>With this device, you could listen to a shellac record (78 RPM) while record concurrently to wire.</p>
            <p>The era of devices using wires to store sound began before the second world war but was already finished at 1965. In this time, tape recorders conquered the market.<br/>Clicking on the picture will show <a href="/en/devices/schaub-lorenz-supraphon.shtm" class="go">a larger and more detailed version</a>.</p>
