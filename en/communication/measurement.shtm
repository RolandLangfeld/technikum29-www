    <p>Professionals can see many beautiful measurement devices, from the complex mirror galvanometer (a piece from the German Kaiserzeit) to the scintillation measuring station with counting devices from several epoches (since 1956), used for measurement of radioactivity.</p>

               This is a remarkably functional, big and beautiful all-purpose measurement device made by Siemens &amp; Halske (about 1910). At that time even simple objects of utulity were made lovely detailed. This device was used as auxiliary device for morsing purposes.

              After the currency reform in West Germany, the production
              of mesurement devices got going again. This AEG
              oscilloscope was built in 1949. It seems to be an exact
              replica from an AEG device of the late thirties. It is
              equipped with steel tubes that were put on the German
              market at 1938. Neither the time base of the horizontal
              deflection nor the amplitude of the vertical deflection
              are callibrated by the manufacturer. To measure
              absolutely with this device, you always need reference sizes.

      <p>In addition to the measurement technology that mostly covers the big area of counting, there are also exhibits which show how electronics was taught in schools since 1930. The picture stated below shows at the top demo models for tube technology (approx. 1935) and galvanometers, demo tubes (approx. 1939) and an oscillating circuit (variometer) under it.</p>

    <p>On the third shelf (counted from the top, in the background) the
       picture shows models of transistorized circuits (from 
       approximately 1965). The big white board in front of these models
       is an experience system from Leybold from the early 1970. At that
       time, the subject "digital electonics" was taught in the school.
       It was a wonderful combination of physics, informatics and
       mathematics.  Unfortunately that time is over, too. In ordinary
       schools, there is no more time for electronics in the curriculars.
       Of course that is not totally wrong: The every day electonics have
       developed too much away from the basis. Thus, the youngest
       generation has no more idea how it's Ipod or mobile phone works
       and they do not even want to learn the basics of electronics
       because the relationship is too complex.</p>
