           This picture shows some devices from the "experimental physics" area. You
           will probably note the use of "natural" materials (wood, glass, metal) and the
           well-designed very simplified interface that makes comprehension simple.
           <br/>We will go into detail for some of the devices shown on the left.

               This is a remarkably functional, big and beautiful all-purpose measurement device made by Siemens &amp; Halske (about 1905). At that time even simple objects of utulity were made lovely detailed. This device was used as auxiliary device for morsing purposes in the national administration of the German Empire.

             <p>Until the invention of measurement amplifiers, measuring very small voltages
             and currents was a big problem. To do that job, moving coil devices had to be
             very sensitive. This was realized with a moving coil that was mounted on a
             torsion wire. The reflecting mirror at the lower end of the wire was spotted by
             a light ray, so the whole composition acts like a very long "light needle".
             By this way very long needle lengths (multiple meters) could be simulated.
             Such a galvanometer must be set up absolutely horizontally and vibration-free.
             <br/>The <b>Mirror Galvanometer</b> by Hartmann&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braun is
             a simple and functional demonstration model from the 1920s.</p>

            At the time where there was no television and no oscilloscope yet, the
            <b>Cathode Ray Tube</b> was a sensation, especially at school. This was one of
            the very first experiments where students could see that electrons have
            almost no inertia, so they can be deflected easily at the presence of an
            electric field.
            <br/>This tube (with power supply on the left) from the German company
            <b>Loewe</b> is an historical piece from the 1930s. It measures about
            50&nbsp;cm!

              After the currency reform in West Germany, the production
              of mesurement devices got going again. This AEG
              oscilloscope was built in 1949. It seems to be an exact
              replica from an AEG device of the late thirties. It is
              equipped with steel tubes that were put on the German
              market at 1938. Neither the time base of the horizontal
              deflection nor the amplitude of the vertical deflection
              are callibrated by the manufacturer. To measure
              absolutely with this device, you always need reference sizes.

             The "Physikalischen Werkst&auml;tten" (<i>phsyical facilities</i>), <b>Phywe</b>,
             have built this small oscilloscope for demonstration purposes that can be
             used to show the electromagnetic interaction of an electron beam in E/B fields.
             Since (CRT driven) television got a mass medium, these experiments
             were state-of-art at those days.

          <b>Leybold</b> from the early 1970s. At that time, the subject
          "digital electonics" was taught in the school. Students could set up
          logic systems like binary counters, full adders, flip-flops, multiplexer,
          etc. This was quite fascinating for students at that time. Today, in ordinary
          schools, there is no more time for electronics in the curriculars.</p>

         <br/>Last but not least we show a composition of (frequency) counters from
         different epoches. There are, among others, devices equipped with tubes (57
         electron tubes) or discrete transistor logic (mostly germanium).
         The different counting tubes (e.g. E1T or GC10B) and the very different
         display types are quite impressive.</p>
