    <p>It is astonishing to see the incredible pace at which the development of
       broadcasting systems took place. Beginning with very simple devices using
       crystals for demodulation the technology matured very fast and resulted
       in the design and development of high performance transmitters and receivers
       employing super heterodyning and the like.
       This paved the way from simple crystal receivers which required special
       skills to operate to everyday radios which were easy to operate and soon
       could be found in nearly every household. A process which took a mere 15
       years from its first steps to near perfection.
       This development is reflected in the appearance of the devices as well. While
       the first receivers were of a very technical design, later devices turned into
       wonderful pieces of furniture, fitting neatly into the average household and
       denying the fact that the receiver itself was a rather complicated piece of
       equipment. This page shows some selected examples from the collection of the
       museum which contains about 150 different receivers.
    </p>

<!--
      <p>The short time between the moderate launch of broadcasting in the early 1920s and its perfection is amazing. The era of broadcasting began in Germany in 1923, at first with very limited reception quality. 15 years later the quality of reception was almost perfect. At the beginning the apparatures had a very technical design (exactly like today), but since the 30s the radio apparatures changed to partially attractive pieces of furniture. Chosen examples from the museum-holding (150 pieces) for both kinds are shown on this page.</p>

          <p class="bildtext">Receiver made by Signalbau Huth (model E72):
            This is an example of a cheap
            receiver made in 1928. It was one of the first models which could
            be connected to the mains thus eliminating the bulky anode batteries
            requires by previous generations of receivers.
            The sound quality of this receiver is quite limited and the horn
            loudspeaker makes for a sound which one would expect from a tin can.</p>

         <p class="bildtext">Wealthy people could afford a <b>Telefunken W9</b>
           (shown in the picture on the left) which was available during the
           same time frame. Equipped with an Acrophon loudspeaker it featured
           a rich sound although with very limited bass. In addition to this
           the receiver was quite sensible and could even receive stations
           far away while the cheap model above was limited to the reception
           of local broadcast stations.</p>
         <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>

      <p>The following pictures show some receivers of outstanding design
         and outstanding technical properties. Apart from these the
         museum's collection contains a lot of different receivers
         covering all stages of the development of public radio
         broadcasting.
         These receivers include crystal radios, battery powered receivers
         from the 1920s, a 'Luxus Super' (1930s) as well as the first postwar
         receiver equipped with motorized search functionality and remote
         control by cable, the SABA Freiburg 3D. The sound of this receiver
         is so rich and impressive that even young people are faszinated and
         admire this 50 year old technical miracle.</p>

<!--
      <p>The next two pictures show two apparatures that point out themselves optically and also technically, but the picture gallery could be continued without stopping.
      <br />Many other curiosities can be admired in the museum, an audio experience is possible in every epoch: detectors, batterie-receivers (1920s), "Luxus-Super" (1930s) and at the end the first postwar receivers with motor-channel search and cable-remote control: SABA Freiburg 3D. The sound of this milestone with 5 built-in loudspeakers is so impressing that even CD-spoiled kids would stand wondering in front of this nearly 50-years old apparature.
      <br />All in all you see how broadcasting was two or three generations ago and how fast the aparatures developed.</p>

            Its circuitry contains 11 vacuum tubes driving two loudspeakers

          <p class="bildtext">The portable reveceiver from Metz, built in
            1956 and shown above, is another outstanding piece of equipment.
            It is a so called "Kofferradio" so it can be carried around and
            it features even an integrated recordplayer - forseeing the
            development of modern multipurpose receiver/CD-player combinations</p>

          <!--
          A rapid leap in time to the youngest model in the museal collection: The portable receiver from Metz with built-in gramophone. Of course the apparature, built 1956, still uses tubes. Youth would have been able to hear their "Elvis Presley"-records in the swimming pool if the radio were much more cheaper.-->
