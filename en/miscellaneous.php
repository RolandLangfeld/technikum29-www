    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

    <h3>Pianola</h3>
    <p>The technikum29 is quite versatile &ndash; beside all the communication
       and computer technology we also show very special exhibits: This is
       a fully executable pianola, year of manufacture about 1910-1915.</p>

    <p>
       It's a great experience see and hear such old jukeboxes, typically made
       only of natural materials like leather, gum, wood, bone glue, felt, metal, paper,
       ivory and glas.
       <br/>By assembling these elements on an intelligent way, one could
       build a simple mechanical machine which is especially impressive
       for today's people. Here at the technikum29, we will show you how
       this device works, we will explain the basic functionality and
       play challenging compositions. While having covers removed, you can
       even see the fascinating mechanics working.

	<h3 id="leander">Art in the Museum</h3> 

<p>The technikum29 motivates activities that get awards and prices. The latest
example is that of the young artist Leander A. Schwarzer who transforms
everyday things into pieces of art. He has developed pictures made from zippers
that can be opened thus giving the viewer the opportunity to modify the picture
itself.<br>
 His latest visit to the technikum29 has inspired him to make art from
and with punch cards which were the basis of industrialization in the 20th
century. First the "Terzett" (Trio) was created which consists of three punched
cards with these irreversible sentences:</p>

<p>These cards were hanged on a wall at a distance of 1-2 cm. During the day sun
rays create shadows of the punched and coded text on the wall behind the cards.
This work of art was awarded a price at the 32th grafics competition in Austria
(Innsbruck, 2011). This in turn motivated Mr. Schwarzer to continue his work
with punched cards. He spent several days at the technikum29 punching excerpts
from Marx' "Capital" thereby creating a pile of several hundred cards. These
were shown in the exhibition "A Symbol of Freedom" in Piacenza (Italy). Punched
cards transform contemporary slogans into visual paradoxes when they create
their unique shadows.</p>

		<p class="Bildtext small">Picture 3: Punched cards running through a "musical clock"</p>
		</div>

<p>Another work, "Fetish Character of commodities", concatenates the cards
containing Marx' text fragments. This string of cards is then pulled through a
mechanism like a musical clock that generates sounds controlled by the holes in
the cards. So, finally, the "Capital" is transformed into atmospheric sounds.</p><br>

	 
	 
	 
    <h3>Movie projector  "Dresden 1"</h3>

     <div class="box left clear-after">

		<div class="bildtext">
          <p>The technikum29 has a movie projector from 1951 (there are
             more and even older projectors from the 1930s that are stored in the
             archive for lack of space).</p>
          <p>
             Movie projectors have always been very complex devices. At that time,
             the bright picture projection was archived with an arc light which was
             generated between two carbon pencils. The waste heat was deflected via a
             chimney pipe! <!-- stupid mode... -->
             Since the pencils got shorter and shorter while the movie went on, they
             had to be moved continously closer together for producing a constant
             luminosity. Otherwise the light goes out.
             <br/>We will repair this device to show an original newsreel from the 1960s.

	<h3 id="demo">Siemens Demonstration Computer</h3>

		<p class="center"><b>Siemens educational computer</b></p>
	</div>

	<p>This demonstration model was build in 1973, when personal computers were not
	   invented for a long time yet. Engineers had to be trained to understand
	   computer architectures. Therefore, this big education model was constructed.
	   It is a giant implementation of a typical register machine where 126 lamps
	   display all registers, control, ALU and RAM, including the data flow.
	   Featuring a mutable clock pulse and only 4 bit word with, elementary opcodes
	   could be reproduced in a very illustrative way. The device can be toggled to
	   process one instruction or one cycle a time.
	<br>On the left side, the computer program could be directly "written" by plugging
	   cartidges labeled with assembly instruction mnemonics or numerical values
	   (immediate operands). On this cartiges the user could directly read the binary
	   value of the machine instruction which will be the content of the corresponding
	   random access field. As you might guess, the computer cannot change the program
	   memory without user interaction, so this model actually implements an Harvard
	   architecture, even though the (german) labels on the frontend suggest something
	   different.
	<br>The picture above shows a currently running program that adds memory cells. It
	   shows that computer word lengths do not limit the length of proccessable
	   numbers.
	<br>It is a wonderful device that can even be used today to understand the elementary
	   workflow of modern high end desktop CPUs.
