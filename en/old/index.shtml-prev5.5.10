        <p>The building after the reconstruction</p>
    </div>

    <p>The museum was officially opened in september 2005.</p>
    <p>It shows the interesting development of technology that strongly
       influences our life.</p>
    <p>In contrast to similar museums that normally only exhibit the history
       of technology without showing their functionality, almost all devices in
       the technikum29 are operative and are demonstrated during the guided
       tours. So you get a totally different picture of that time.</p>

    <p>The museum is located in Germany, close to Frankfurt/Main
       (more precisely: 65779 Kelkheim). It is privately owned and run and has
       currently about 250 square meters of exhibition floor space. It is open
       for interested visitors in a biweekly fashion on Sundays.
       <br />You can approach us by
       <a class="arrow" href="mailto:post@technikum29.de">post@technikum29.de</a>.</p>

    <p>Now some pictures that show the exhibits we got at least:</p>

        <p class="justify">A small sensation: The <b>technikum</b> has got a complete mainframe computer (year
         of manufacture 1969) in september 2005. The well-preserved system UNIVAC 9400 has four tons overall
         weight and 13 meters total length! The transport from Cologne to Kelkheim was underwritten by the
         company UNISYS (succesor to Sperry-Univac). We have scaled down the system for lack of space.
         Two specialists are trying to refloat it. Then it certainly will be Europe's only computer (from that UNIVAC
         series) that is still executable.</p>

    <p>The virtual tour only shows some of the exhibits. Let's start a trip to the
     technical past &ndash; note there is no future without the past,
     therefore museums are an important part of the human cultural history.
