    <p>The first electronically calculating calculators were gigantic mainframes
    in the 1940/50s. Until then, calculators worked mechanically.
    <!--Calculators worked mechanically until they could calculate electronically, which was
    only possible with gigantic mainframe computers in the 1940/50s.-->

    When the handwheel was replaced by an electric engine, the era of mechanical calculators began.
    The first printing mechanical calculator (1905) is an unicum with an huge exterior engine!
    From the first fully automatic machines (1927) until these with balancing memory
    (1960s), mechanical calculators calculated independently after the input of the numbers.
    The world's first "pocket calculator machine", Curta I, has 1/3 from the volume of a
    Coca Cola-pin and is consequently the smallest four-species machine ever built.
    If you look at the picture of Curta I (shown below), you recognize the enormous importance of the
    positional notation.</p>

          thus they made a 4-species calculating machine.
          The comfortable usability seems to be the reason why they called it "Superautomat".</p>

        <p class="bildtext"><b>DIEHL VSR-18</b>, one of many mechanical calculators
        built between 1955 and 1965.
        <br/>The engineers were hardly pressed to design better and better machines, until
        the limit of feasibility. So the operating instructions say: "This DIEHL-device VSR
        performs outstanding work". That is really true: For example, one were able to
        cache results and to transfer back them anytime you want to. With this feature
        daily calculations like 25 + 12 x 7 - 17 x 6 could be solved without notating
        anything. However, this luxury still had a drawback: You must not run them wrongly,
        because they were highly sensitive agains any operating error.</p>
