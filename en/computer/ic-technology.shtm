      <p>The development of IC-technology 1967/68 came along with the development of
      high-perfomance calculators. We have also arrayed the world's most expensive desk calculator:
      WANG 700. This device outshined everything other on the market (costed with very extensive
      periphery much more than 70.000,-&nbsp;DM or 35.000,-&nbsp;Euro).
      Furthermore the first alphanumerically displaying calculator (HP 9820, 1971) and the
      world's first BASIC-programmable desk calculator (HP 9830, 1972) are installed.
      With these systems you can marvellously plot function graphes together with its label.
      Three years before something like this was unimaginable!
      1971 the first scientifically programmable "pocket calculators" with the size of
      a matchbox came on the market, too.

          <p class="bildtext">In this photo you see the extract from the <b>WANG 700</b> installation.
          The core is a calculator with two-line nixie-tube display, 2&nbsp;kB core memory and
          integrated cassette tape for program recording. Right in the front is the
          Mark Sense card reader, the manual card reader behind.
          The programming, a numerical assembly language, was very fiddly.
          The plotter program contains 794 (!) commands. An HP-Calculator (eg. 9830) could execute
          a much more comfortable plotter program (HP-Basic) with only 36 commands two years later.</p>

             <p>The picture shows a unique system with a <b>WANG 700</b> at its heart. It is a one-of-a-kind machine and was built specifically for the department of mathematical didactics of a German university. Students of pure mathematics were forced to compete for the scarce CPU time on the university's mainframe while students of mathematical didactics had exclusive access to the system shown which eventually led to some arguments between both faculties.</p>
            <p>On the left the calculator itself can be seen &ndash; it features a two line display made from so called NIXIE-tubes, has 2 kB core memory and a built in cassette drive for mass storage. For years this machine was the fastest desktop calculator in the world.</p>
            <p>In the middle the optical reader can be seen (which, in fact, obscures the manual punch card reader which can not be seen in this picture). On the right is a modified IBM selectric typewriter which can not only be used to print out text, but to create plots of functions as well. Below the calculator an alphanumeric keyboard can be found; on the bottom an additional dual cassette tape drive is located. Programming of this machine was quite cumbersome - a simple plotterprogram took 794 program steps to perform a task which could be done on a later HP desktop calculator like the HP 9830 in only 36 steps using HP-BASIC as its programming language.</p>
