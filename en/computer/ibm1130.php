		<p>Since December 2013, we own a very nice and also quite interesting "Electronic Computing System" by IBM. This type was delivered for the first time in 1965.
There is much to report about, but in first place the optical and electronical restoration of the Computer have to be realized. This section will be continued within a short time.</p><br>

<!-- <p><small>This system was transferred by FITG (Frankfurt) for what we are deeply grateful.</small></p>
