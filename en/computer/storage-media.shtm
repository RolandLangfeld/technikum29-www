      In the following some types of memory are described which are found in the computers on display at the technikum29. These devices may be classified as either RAM (random access memory) or ROM (read only memory). Due to their respective size these are very demonstrative examples.
      <br/>The problem of storing information is of central importance for digital computers and was a difficult area during the early days of computing. In these times building a fast processor was considerably more easy than building an equally fast and large memory system for this processor. This led to some rather arcane solutions which are completely extinct today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays as well as 50 years ago, these characteristical attributes are important:
    </p>

    <ul>
           <li>cycle time</li>
           <li>packing density</li>
           <li>costs / bit</li>
           <li>(thermal) power loss</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Storages are classified geometrically:</p>
    <ul>
           <li>one-dimensional alignment (e.g. the delay line memory)</li>
           <li>two-dimensional alignment (e.g. drom storage, disk storage)</li>
           <li>three-dimensional alignment (e.g. core memory, the number of layers is the word length)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These physical principles has been used: electrostatic charge (storage tube),
       propagation of acoustic waves (delay line memories), ferromagnetism (core memory,
       plated wire memory, drum/disk memory), holography (optical memories). The most important
       and most spread memories are the ferromagnetic memories.</p>

            One of these solutions is the so called delay line memory.
            It consists of several chained LC-oscillators that are set
            up as low-pass filters. In this circuit the pulses are carried slower compared
            to ohmic conductors. Due to the high damping the pulses must be amplified again.
            Therefore the memory is equipped with 12 tube amplifiers. After amplification
            at the end of the LC chain, the information is read in at the beginning of the
            chain again. In this way it runs permanentely throught the delay line memory.
            <br/>The pictures show a memory unit which is capable of storing a decimal
            integer with only 12 digits. Obviously storage was very expensive in the early
            times of computing.

           Another kind of "delay line" memory is the so called magnetostrictive memory. This technique is based on the idea of the propagation of ultrasonic waves through a thin wire. The information to be stored is fed into a long wire by the effect of magnetostricion (the wire contracts when exposed to a strong magnetic field &ndash; this in turn yields an acoustic wave traveling across the wire). A bit pattern created by this effect travels along the wire to its end where the information is picked up by a piezo electric element. The output of this pickup will be amplified and fed back into the beginning of the wire loop.</p>
           <p>This basically yields a sequential storage circuit - an impulse pattern will run in an endless loop through the wire. To insert information into the loop some (simple) additional circuitry is necessary. To delete bits, the feedback loop will be opened while setting bits requires an OR gate at the input of the wire loop.</p>
           <p>This type of memory is volatile and has a rather long access time &ndash; on the other hand, its capacity depends mainly on the length of the wire and the basic clock of the surrounding circuitry so it may easily expanded. In addition to this it is relatively inexpensive and rugged making it suitable for applications like desktop calculators and the like.</p>

        <div class="bildtext">
            <p>The picture shows a core memory made by Triumpf (about 1961). The circuit card, measuring 16 cm by 20 cm, can store 144 bit which equals 12 machine words of 12 bits each (which was a common word length in this time). Thus a single bit occupies an area of about 2.2 square centimeters.</p>

            Another core memory made in 1969 is shown here. It is used in the <a href="/en/devices/univac9400/highspeed-printer.shtm">high speed printer</a> of the <a href="univac9400.shtm">UNIVAC mainframe</a> and stores a single line of text to be printed (132 characters).

       <div class="bildtext">
           <p>During the years the capacity of core memory devices was increased more and more while the dimensions were shrinked accordingly. This picture shows a core memory plane made in the time frame 1975 - 1978. The area shown equals
that of the 144 bit memory by Triumph shown earlier. Now there are more then 16000 cores on the same area. The individual cores can only be seen with the aid of a magnifying glass. The whole core memory block contains 16 planes like this containing more then 256000 single cores (this is equivalent to 32 kB of data) occupying a volume of about 2.5 cubic decimeters. This device marks the end of the era of core memory.</p>

           <p>The smaller the individual cores the faster the access time &ndash; this device features an access time of only 200 ns. One drawback of core memory is that reading the information stored in a row of cores destroys the information. So every read access has to be followed by a write access to retain the information (reading from a core memory takes more time than writing to the memory which is a rather unique "feature" of this technology).</p>

           <p>A major advantage of core memory is its non-volatility. The information stored in a core memory will be retained even when power is lost. It is possible to turn on a machine switched off in 1975 and continue operation at the very same step where it ended in 1975. Even today main memory is sometimes called "core" which is a reminiscence of the early days of computing when memory was in fact core memory. A memory dump as a result of a program crash is still called "core dump" in the UNIX operating systems family, for example.</p>

       <p>The plated wire storage was intended for replacing the core memory.  Our
          <a href="/en/devices/univac9400/univac_9300.shtm">UNIVAC 9300</a> is equipped
          with this type of memory that was initially announced by UNIVAC for the new
          UNIVAC 9000 series as a "technical revolution" in their magazine "The punch card"
          in 1967.</p>
       <p>While research and development in the Goddard Space Flight Center of the US space
          program, NASA, the american government closed a deal with UNIVAC to develop a
          storage medium with a total input power less then 1 Watt, non-destructive readout
          (that is, no more neccessarity to write the informations after reading them),
          high capacity, low cycle time and functionality in a temperature range from
          -20° C to +50°C (-4°F to 122°F).
          <br/>In this way the plated wire storage was developed, based on a cuple of
          genious ideas. Unfortunately, nowadays it is very error-prone.</p>

       <p class="bildtext">
           As already described before (section <a class="go" href="programmable.shtm">programmable 2nd generation desktop calculators</a>), the DIEHL Combitron calculator used a time delay memory (like the magnetostrictive memory described elsewhere). Since this type of memory is volatily, DIEHL needed a non-volatile memory for the overall control of the machine. This had been implemented using a two channel punched tape. The first channel serves as a clock channel while the second channel contains the actual control data.
           <br/>During the startup of the calculator, the contents of this punched tape were copied to the time delay memory which then took over control of the machine.
