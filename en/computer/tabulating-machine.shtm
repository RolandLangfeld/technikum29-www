    <p>Tabulating machines were widely used when electronic data processing
       began in the 1950s. These big machines were called "technical marvels":
       At a glance at the inner life you can see what special art of
       ingeneering was performed at that time. This kind of technology appears
       odd for today's folks.</p>

    <p>The tabulating machine BULL BS-PR was constructed in October 1956, thus it
       is the oldest pice of EDP in the museum. At these days you could buy it
       for about 260.000 German marks (about 62.000 US$).
       Nevertheless even medium-sized businesses had to buy these punch card
       machines to work economically.</p>

    <p>On high quality tabulating machines the patch panel could be replaced to
       perform very different tasks. By plugging the cables on the programming field 
       cleverly, even some scientifical caluclations could be solved.
    <br/>For every new program the software engineer had to plug a new
       programming field. The only data input medium are punch cards. Therefore
       we own other machines that are also operational to perform card driven EDP,
       that is, devices for creation, sorting, mixing, etc. the cards.</p>

    <p>Our tabluating machine is now even capable of calculating and printing bank
       statements as well as multiplying and dividing.
    <!-- <LOL> -->
    <br/>In the year 1959 some BULL engineer asked himself why there was not some
       algorithm for the tabulating machine somewhere outside to compute square roots.
       Since he was bored, he knew already dozens of simple algorithms he learned
       in his study of computer science and he wanted to gouge his friends, he
       bet them that you could compute square roots of any real number with a
       tabulating machine. Since his friends have not studied computer science,
       they bet against it. The engineer made some programming efforts and won
       the bet. We came across that program, so we are currently trying to get
       it back running, so we can relive that historical moment. <!-- </LOL> -->

         looks like a strange chunk made of metal, but it comprises impressive
         electromechanical technology.
	 <br />Multiplying and dividing mechanically needs lots of time. To shorten
	 this amount of time, you could attach the "electronical calculator" BULL
	 GAMMA&nbsp;3. The auxiliary tube calculator was only used for this purpose.
	 Unfortunately it is no more available.</p>

            The picture on the left shows the heart of the Bull BS-PR. In the foreground the card sensing circuitry can be seen. Every card is sensed twice &ndash; the first run determines if it is a program or a data card while the second run (below) reads the actual data. In addition to that this mechanism allows the comparison of successive cards.

           alt="The BULL GAMMA 3, closed state" width="156" height="210" />
      <p class="bildtext">
        The BULL GAMMA 3 was build since 1952. It could be connected to several
        punchcard devices, for example to the Tabulating Machine BS, to the
        card copier PRD and to the ULP puncher.
        <br/>Our GAMMA 3 installation is fully developed and features seven
        delay line memory units each with a capacity of 12 decimal digits. To
        extend the built-in memory, there were special so-called "storage cabinets"
        that contained additional 24 storage units, each with a capacity
        of 12 decimal numbers.
        <br/>Summing up, the calculator features almost 400 electron tubes.
        Thyratrons were used to connect this fast calculator to the slow
        punchcard auxillary devices. A thyratron tube is capable of saving
        temporary digital states.

        The modules could be folded out, hence the calculator is quite
        service friendly. Two big fans circulate fresh air thorught the
        case. On the left you can see a part of the big power supply &ndash;
        39 fuses keep the electric circuits seperated for additional security.

        <br/>When this calculator is connected to our BULL Tabulating Machine,
        all the information from the papertape reader brushes are directly
        transfered to the GAMMA 3. Thus programs and data can be manipulated
        directly by the GAMMA 3. The output is transfered back to the
        printing unit from the Tabulating Machine.

        In 1963 BULL General Electric presented the BULL GAMMA 10
        which was intended for commercial purpose and puchcard
        computing. The standard equipment contains a CPU with
        panel, a punchcard reader/puncher unit and a barrel printer.
        The RAM consists of a 1kb core memory which could be
        extended up to 4kb capacity. There are 59 different
        opcodes to program the CPU.
        <br/>The cycle time from the core memory is 7 micro
        seconds. The calculator is capable of reading and
        punching 300 cards per minute. Five punchcards per
        second, that is an amazing speed &ndash;
        therefore the punching unit is generously built. The
        printer can only print up to 300 lines per minute. Compared
        to our <a href="univac9400.shtm">Univac 9400</a> this
        is quite slow &ndash; the Univac 9400 is capable of
        printing more than 1000 lines per minute.

          <a href="/en/search.shtm">We are looking for...</a>). By now the
          complete mechanics works again. After tuning the temperature
          of the heated core memory and switching some defect
	  transistors, we can already execte a program for duplicating
	  punch cards, as well as the first mathematical programs.
	  That's really sensational for such an old computer.
