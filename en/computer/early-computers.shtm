    <p>Today's kids think of the latest mobile devices when talking about "mini computers". In contrast, in the 1960s and the early 70s, a computer was always huge (like our <a href="univac9400.shtm">UNIVAC mainframe</a>), thus a 300kg computer was "mini". Early computers are well worth seeing due to their enormous size and the nice transparent auxillary devices.
       <br />There is a very important computer family that finally lead to today's (personal) computers: The development of the "Mini" computers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), series PDP-8. The museum owns a complete production run from that devices: From the PDP-8 (also called Classic-8), year of manufacture 1965 to the PDP-8a (1975, this one is less important so it is located in the archive).

    <!--alter Text: The legendary Classic PDP 8 from the company DEC (year of manufacture 1965) can be admired among others. Furthermore you can see the PDP 8L or <a class="go" href="/en/devices/pdp_8I.shtm">PDP 8I</a> (year of manufacture 1967, a lot of periphery) and the laboratory computer <a class="go" href="/en/devices/lab_8e.shtm">LAB8e</a> (1971).
    Because of constantly growing claims for storage capacity, backing storage (19-zoll drawers for 4kB with a weight of 20kg) was offered. The PDP 8I could not administrate more than 32kB.
    <br />THe PDP 8L, a trimmed-down version of the PDP 8I, cannot hold more than 8 kB.</p> -->

	<p>
         One of the museal highlights: The complete PDP-8 system with processor,
         big tape deck TU 580 (originally belongs to the PDP-5, year of manufacture
         1963), punch card reader/puncher PC 01, hard disc DF 32 with immovable heads
         and a teletype as printer. The Classic PDP-8 is called the world's first mass-produced
         "minicomputer". Without ICs or their ancestor it is a seccond-generation apparature.
         <!-- The <b>Classic PDP 8</b> from DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation, Massachusetts):
         He is considered to be the world's first mass-produced "minicomputer" (1965). "Mini" is relative: Only too very
         strong men can lift the computer. It is better to have four people to carry it!.
         Without ICs or their ancestors the device is counted among the seccond-generation calculators.
         <br/>You can also get a view from the "Flip-Chip"-card from the <a class="go" href="/en/devices/pdp-8-left-flank.shtm">left flank</a>
         (<u>flank</u>). The core memory is set above (storage capacity 4kB).-->

            <h3>PDP-8I</h3>
            <p>DEC's first calculator with integrated circuits was not cheap. The CPU on
             its own (in the middle of the picture) without periphery costed 27000$ at that time.<br/>
             The main memory had a capacity of 8kB. While calculating a "bigger" problem, possibly some files
             (programs, data) had to be swapped on a (magnetic) tape and read in afterwards. DEC developed
             a very intelligent operating system (OS/8) which could work very efficiently with such few memory.
             It is very interesting to watch this computer working.</p>
            <p>If you have not yet seen such a computer, you should know that it is more than 2m high (with
             plotter) and has a weight of more than 300 kg.</p>
            <p>The periphery constists of 2 x TU 55 (tape drives), PC 04 (high speed paper tape reader),
             Calcomp 563 plotter (at the top) and of course a teletype (not in the picture).</p>

			<h3 id="pdp12">PDP-12, LAB-12</h3>
			<p>The PDP-12 was released in 1969. It was the last series that
			could operate in Link modus (it could be switched to either Link-8
			or PDP-8). This is a laboratory computer, equipped with AD and DA
			converter as standard. Such computers were usually kept up to date
			with hardware updates. The memory of this device was gradually
			increased from 8kB up to 32kB (DW 08E storage extension).
			<br>Beside the tape drives, the computer was also equipped with
			an 8-inch floppy drive. Afterwards they were removed again in
			favor of two removable disk drives. Finally they even tied the
			device to 10BASE-T ethernet, using a selfmade controller with an
			handwritten TCP/IP stack on a selfmade operating system.
			Thus this device can demonstrate the era of paper tapes until
			today's storage standard.
			<br>We will repair it and report further details at this point.</p>

            <h3>Lab-8e, PDP-8e</h3>
            <p>Successor of the PDP-8i was the PDP-8e (1970). This computer had already an
             internal bus system. So you could easily attach any periphery with interface cards. This
             feature made the "Mini"computer all-purpose. This Computer type was offered with diverse
             A/D- and D/A-converters and connection facilities as laboratory computer for analogue
             devices (shown in the picture). The periphery is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>VR 12 (oscilloscope display)</li>
                <li>PC 04 (High speed paper tape reader/puncher)</li>
                <li>3 x TU 56 (double tape drive)</li>
                <li>A/D- and D/A-converter</li>

    <h3>WANG 2200 with bulky peripheral hardware</h3>
    <p>Furthermore the first system that looks like a today's computer is connected: <a class="go" href="/en/devices/wang2200.shtm">WANG 2200</a>, year of manufacture 1973. The computer with so much peripheral devices is propably unique in Germany. The periphery: paper tape reader, reader for stacked cards, 8-inch triple disc drive, disc system with 38cm big disks (the device has a weight of 100kg and costed 24.000,- DM whereas it only saved 5MB), special basic-keyboard, etc.</p>
    <p>WANG quickly recognized that the future of computers needed screens. However the concurrent HP built his
    computers only with a single LED display until 1975.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The first personal computer was also build by WANG: PCS II (1975). The first PC that was affordable for everybody was the PET 2001 from Commodore. It came on the market in 1977 and was as cheap as a today's PC but saved 8kB and had decent applications. Many more Homepcomputer followed, the market got out of hand and therewith the collection of computers ends.</p>
