	<p>The Univac 9200 (Univac 9300) is a punch card computing data center from 1966. It is not
	   common that such old devices are completely preserverd, even all
	   manuals are available. This system was stored over four years in the museum
	   archives until we moved it with a freight company just into the museum, next
	   to the <a href="univac9400.shtm">UNIVAC 9400</a>.</p>
	   
	<p>After moving the devices with a trucking company to the museum buidling,
	   the restauration started with cleaning all the devices, removing the typical
	   old rotten noise-absorbing mats at the very first. They have been replaced by
	   brand new cellular rubber.</p>

    <p>We expect most of the problems with all the mechanical parts that take most
	   of the place in the cabins. We already removed transportation lockings
	   <!-- LOL - wirkt inhaltich echt behindert, sowas geht sonst ja schnell ;) -->
	   and replaced some bearings, drive rollers and belts. The card puncher features
	   15 timing belts, for instance.
	   The card reader (500 cards/minute) works again and the puncher mechanics is
	   now executable, too. The processor link of these auxillary devices is another
	   issue and will be checked in the near future.</p>

		</div>
		
	<p>For optical reasons, we also repainted the cases.</p>
	<p>Afterwards, we will address the bar printer. In contrast to the already
       mentioned devices, the printer cannot be controlled manually, so we will
	   start up the processor, too. This will be a buggy job, too.
	   But all the work is not for nothing, <!-- sic! gute uebersetzung -->
	   since the system is really unique, featuring punch card assembler programming.</p>

	<p>We will continously update this page about the progress of the reparation
	   untill the device is fully functional again.</p>

	<p><b>17.01.2010:</b> There were some mice in the power supply and printer, they
	   bit thorught some small cables.
	<p><b>16.02.2010:</b> After locating two defect resistances the power supply is
	   running again. Thus we can use punch card devices from the CPU by now. Actually
	   we cannot read nor punch data.
	<br>Now there is another malfunctioning device: The <a href="storage-media.shtm#plated-wire-storage">
	   plated wire storage</a> does not work. We try to get it working at least a bit,
	   replacing it with a new selfmade solid state memory. As you can read on our
	   <a href="/en/devices/plated-wire-storage.shtm">detailed description of the
	   plated wire storage</a>, this type of memory has always been very error-prone.

		<p class="bildtext" style="width:400px;"><b>UNIVAC 9300 front panel:</b> 160
                states of processor and periphery can be indicated with light bulbes and
		selected via switches.</p>
	</div>
	<p><b>15.04.2010:</b> The boot process of the device is still crashing. There is
	    an error message from the printer without any reason. We are trying to
		locate this error.
	<p><b>02.05.2010:</b> A broken thyristor (hammer driver) raised the
	    "printer error" message. Data integrity was the most important part at those
		time: If only one of the 140 printer columns is not working correctly, the whole
		printer goes offline to avoid wrong output.
	<p><b>10.05.2010:</b> We could get the plated wire storage online. We
	    can even start some small test programs via the input switches, but there are
		bugs while running. This is perhaps the unique device that still uses the old
		plated wire storage. Anyway we are planing a replacement.
	<p><b>12.06.2010:</b> After callibrating the optical card reader, we could read in
	   and execute small programs in the data memory. We will report about the high
	   security level at the card reading process later. Surprisingly the plated wire
	   storage still works.</p>
	<p><b>16.06.2010:</b> The card puncher doesn't work any more. 30 years inactivity
	   are a long time for computers, too.
	   <br>On the other side, we could execute a printer loop program. The huge printer
	   starts up, but doesn't print yet. After two minutes, a thermal fuse triggers.</p>
	<p><b>25.06.2010:</b> The fuse is triggerd by a broken centrifugal switch from the
	   printer engine start-up windings. Therefore the winding was always on and
	   dissipated constantly current. Now the engine is running, but print commands
	   are not yet executed.
	   <br>We also could find a bug in the memory. Now all 8kB seem to run completely
	   error-free.</p>
	<p><b>30.06.2010:</b> We could locate another bug in the printer logic (faulty
	   transistor). The first time after 30 years, the bar printer works and is capable of
	   printing files from various punch cards. The type face looks good.
	   <br>Now we turn towards the damaged printer.</p>
	<p><b>05.08.2010:</b> After replacing a broken transistor and injecting some oil,
	   the puncher is up and running! Now we are able of duplicating punch cards.
	   Unfortunately we had to disable the error checking functions since the device
	   detected a non-existing error at punching. Locating this error is the next
	   problem.</p>
	<p><b>26.08.2010:</b> Locating this bug in the device's internal error checking
	   of punched data was hard work. The computer compares the data which should be
	   punched with the position of the hammers in the punch station in a very
	   complex way. Only one of the 24 inductive sensing elements was broken,
	   furthermore a transistor which amplifies the particular induced voltage was
	   out of order and there was a cold solder joint. Finally the complete sensing
	   station had to be recallibrated to deliver all information simultaneously to
	   the comparing element. The adjustment has only a margin of 5 microseconds.
	   After this reparation, all duplicated punch cards are checked, too. If there
	   is a wrong punch hole, the computer stops immediately (an event that occurs
	   extremely rare as from now).</p>
