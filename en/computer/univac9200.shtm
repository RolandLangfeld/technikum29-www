	<p>The Univac 9200 is a punch card computing data center from 1966. It is not
	   common that such old devices are completely preserverd, furthermore all
	   manuals are available. This system was stored over four years in the museum
	   archives until we moved it with a freight company just into the museum, next
	   to the <a href="univac9400.shtm">UNIVAC 9400</a>.</p>
	   
	<p>The restauration started with cleaning all the devices, removing the typical
	   old rotten noise-absorbing mats at the very first. They have been replaced by
	   brand new cellular rubber.</p>

    <p>We expect most of the problems with all the mechanical parts that take most
	   of the place in the cabins. We already removed transportation lockings
	   <!-- LOL - wirkt inhaltich echt behindert, sowas geht sonst ja schnell ;) -->
	   and replaced some bearings, drive rollers and belts. The card puncher features
	   15 timing belts, for instance.
	   The card reader (500 cards/minute) works again and the puncher mechanics is
	   now executable, too. The processor link of these auxillary devices is another
	   issue and will be checked in the near future.</p>

	<p>For optical reasons, we will also repaint the cases.</p>
	<p>Afterwards, we will address the bar printer. In contrast to the already
       mentioned devices, the printer cannot be controlled manually, so we will
	   start up the processor, too. This will be a buggy job, too.
	   But all the work is not for nothing, <!-- sic! gute uebersetzung -->
	   since the system is really unique, featuring punch card assembler programming.</p>
	   
	<p><i>We will continuously update this page about the progress of the reparation.
	   Please come again later to get the latest details.</i></p>
