    <p>Analog computers were used for the calculation of mathematical, phycial and technical problems. They were especially capable of solving equations containing variables which are dependent on time or differential equations.</p>

    <p>Analog computers simulate the given problem by abstract it to a physical system which follows the same mathematical laws. This system is "plugged together" on a patch-board by using electronical networks which are situated in the computer's inner life (negators, summing unit, integrator, multiplier, function generator, etc.). Therewith even non-linear problems which differential equations which cannot be solved in a notation free of integrals can be solved with analog computers.</p>

    <p>Among others, computer systems by Telefunken (1961-64) are installed. They draw awesome curves on a storage oscilloscope and xy plotter. They solve difficult problems quite quickly, but handing, programming (plug connections) and analysis is not easy.</p>

    <!--alter Text: <p>Electronical analog computers solved mathematical equations that represented electrical networks which you had to plug ("programm") on the board. They were solved by the electrical simulation. Results were not numbers, but graphs (curves) that can be plotted with a writer or an oscilloscope.</p>-->

        <p>Heathkit, known for it's construction kits, developed an analoge computer in 1956 that was primary designed for education. This monster has 70 tubes, whereas 45 were placed external due to better cooling. It is equipped with 15 computing amplifiers.</p>

          It demonstrates archaic early technology from the first generation. We will refloat it and equipp it with a tube filled xy plotter

        <p>This is a very small analog computer that was designed for educational purpose. It was built since 1960 and
           was equipped with only 17 tubes (whereas 5 were used for stabilisation of voltage). With such a sparse
           equipment the device is just good enough to yield the function of an analog computer &ndash; it is too
           inexactly to be used for real computing.</p>

            The image shows the <b>Telefunkten RAT 700</b> in the bottom (first model from 1961), above a part from the
            successor. On the new model you can change the whole patch board and thus change prgorams quickly.
            <br/>When it's running, you hear an undetermined buzzing (400 Hz), due to the mechanical chopper
            that change direct voltage in alternating voltage. That was the only chance to disable the
            disturbing termeratre drift (Changing of the germanium transistor parameters).

        <h3>EAI 180 digital-anloge computer</h3>
        <div class="bildtext" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <p><b>EAI 180</b> from "Electronic Associates Incorporated",
            New Jersey, is a so called <b>hybrid computer</b>  (hybris [greek]: From twofold parentage), year of
            manufacture 1970. It contains the parts of an analoge computer and these from a digital computer. The
            device is equipped with IC's from the first generation (DTL-technology). The calculation circuit is
            plugged with cables on the front panel. The cycle time from the analoge part can be set to less than
            10ms. With that parameter, an equation will be solved at least 100 times per second. So you can watch
            the output with a simple oscilloscope.

             The EAI 185 is almost exactly the same as the EAI 180 (shown in the photo above). The
             only difference is the stage of expansion &ndash; you will notice that the EAI 185 is
             much more taller than the EAI 180.
             They were both used in the applied physics and informatics of German Technical Universities.

             The analog computer DO 240, made by the German enterprise DORNIER, is a high precision device,
             compared to the EAI hybrid computers, which were used almost only for education due to their
             moderate precision.
             It features very much elements in a highly compact case. Among others there are digital potentiometers
             (gating pulse manually adjustable), a highly customizable digital clock generator (which uses
             nixie tubes as a display), a digital counter, two function generators and many more.
             This computer was built in the early 1970s and was priced at 80.000 DM (about 40.000 euro/dollar)
