<br><br><hr>
	  <p>We soon get an LGP 30 computer withe tubes build in 1956. Unfortunately lacks some cables. Therefore we are looking for 37-pin circular connectors (-jacks) built by Cannon, see picture below. The diameter is about 40mm.
Other 40-pin connectors would help us further too.</p><br>
