    <h2>We are looking for...</h2><br>


<p><b>We soon get a complete IBM 1130 ("electronic computing system"), built circa 1965/66.
Therefore we are looking for anything that can be raise for this computer: Manuals, programs and boards especially with the small monolithic ICs.</b><br>
Old IBM engineers: Please browse through your basement, whether you still can find something about IBM 1130 System. Thank you very much!</p>
