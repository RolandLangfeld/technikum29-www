           <h2>What's special about it?</h2>
           <ul>
               <li>Our museum shows the interesting development of technology
                   that strongly influences our life</li>
               <li>In contrast to similar museums that normally only exhibit
                   the history of technology without showing their functionality,
                   almost all devices in the technikum29 are operational and are
                   demonstrated during the guided tours. So you get a totally
                   different picture of that time. This is quite absolutely
                   unique </li>

                    origin of today's technolgy. You don't have to be
                    an expert: Almost everybody can find an interesting
                    part in our broad spectrum of possibilities.</li>
