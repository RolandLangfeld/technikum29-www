           <h2>Operational computer history</h2>
           <ul>
               <li>Almost all exhibits in our museum are restored and fully functional:
                   They can be turned on and take the user back to a time of
                   oil, mechanics, shaky buttons and glowing bulbs.
               <li>This is very different to popular computer history and science
                   museums. The operation of our devices are always demonstrated
                   during the guided tours. Visitors
                   get a completely different impression of the circumstances of
                   that time. 
               <li>We concentrate on the first devices which were called "computers",
                   i.e. a time span of roughly 1927 until 1972. We do not cover
                   personal computers (late 1970s and beyond) at all. On principle,
                   almost all of our machines are big and bulky, they can be opened
                   and one can watch the machine do computational steps.

            <h2>Didactics and labs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Naturally, our museum attracks "veterans" who worked with
                    these machines in the past. We recognize the knowledge and
                    work together to restore the machines.
                <li>Our most pleasant target group are kids, school classes
                    and students.
                    We organize workshops to build and program both old and new
                    technology.
                <li>On a regular level, we carry out guided tours for everybody.
                    We attract people throughout Germany and neighbouring contries.
                    <!--However, our tours are only held in German.-->
                <li>We also host cultural events in the scope of broadcasting
                    our message. We frequently invite speakers from science and
                    industry in order to highlight the development and importance
                    of computer history.
