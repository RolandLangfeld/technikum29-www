    <h3>Pianola</h3>
    <p>The technikum29 is quite versatile &ndash; beside all the communication
       and computer technology we also show very special exhibits: This is
       a fully executable pianola, year of manufacture about 1910-1915.</p>

    <p>
       It's a great experience see and hear such old jukeboxes, typically made
       only of natural materials like leather, gum, wood, bone glue, felt, metal, paper,
       ivory and glas.
       <br/>By assembling these elements on an intelligent way, one could
       build a simple mechanical machine which is especially impressive
       for today's people. Here at the technikum29, we will show you how
       this device works, we will explain the basic functionality and
       play challenging compositions. While having covers removed, you can
       even see the fascinating mechanics working.

    <h3>Movie projector  "Dresden 1"</h3>

     <p>The technikum29 has a movie projector from 1951 (there are
        more and even older projectors from the 1930s that are stored in the
        archive for lack of space).</p>
     <p>
        Movie projectors have always been very complex devices. At that time,
        the bright picture projection was archived with an arc light which was
        generated between two carbon pencils. The waste heat was deflected via a
        chimney pipe! <!-- stupid mode... -->
        Since the pencils got shorter and shorter while the movie went on, they
        had to be moved continously closer together for producing a constant
        luminosity. Otherwise the light goes out.
        <br/>We will repair this device to show an original newsreel from the 1960s.
