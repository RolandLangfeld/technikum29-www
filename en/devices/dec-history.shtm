   <p>Everything started with just an idea: A young engineer from the famous <i>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</i> had seen the novel computer <em>Whirlwind</em> which worked fundamentally different to the common <em>Eniac</em> computer generation at the Lincoln Lab.
     <br/>While <em>Eniac</em> computers used batch processing, the new computer implemented the idea of <em>interactive computing</em>.</p>
 
    <p>At first sight he recognized the advantages of the new form of computer interaction and the possibilities for even inexperienced computer users. The name of this man was Ken Olsen. His aim was to build an interactive computer for all purposes.
	    <br/>In August 1957, he founded a small company with three collaborators. He named the new company <em>Digital Equipment Corporation</em>. This name was chosen to obscure his real targets. The big and well-established enterprises like IBM should think that DEC just builds auxillary devices.</p>

    <p>Three years later, in 1960, Digital presented the first commercial interactive "mini" computer. This was the first PDP system (Programmable Data Processor). It used a word length of 18 bit and costed approx. 120.000 US$. Digital selled only 53 units.</p>

	<p>The begin of mass producing mini computers represents the next milestone. In 1965 Digital presented this first mass produced PDP, called PDP-8. It was sensationally cheap and costed only 18.000 US$.
	   <br/>Successors of this hit series were the PDP 8I (1967, first computer featuring TTL ICs), PDP 8L (1968, low cost version), PDP 8e (1970, first computer with bus system), later on the PDP 8a and DEC Mate Systems were produced.</p>
