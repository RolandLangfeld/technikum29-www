<p class="justify">The capacity of core memories increased while volume decreased.
The picture shows a memory plane (year of manufacture approx. 1975-1978).
The cores are not visible anymore to the naked eye. There are more than
16000 cores in this plane. They are only visible by magnification.
The memory block contains 16 planes with overall approximately 256000 cores so
it can save 32kB (8 bit word length). Therefore 2.5 dm&sup3; were needed!
That shows the limits and the end of that era.

<br>The smaller the ring core, the smaller the access time. Here it is
approx. 0.2 &micro;s. When the information that is saved on a core
(anticlockwise or clockwiese magnetism stands for "0" and "1" respectively)
is read out, it is demagnetised. For this reason it needs to be remagnetised
so the content of the bit is not loosed. The total cyclus time is
about 0.5 &micro;s. (compared to a 2kb delay line memory that has a cyclus
time of 1 ms it is 2000 times smaller! However a semiconductor memory from 1975
had a cyclus time that was smaller than 100 ns).</p>

<p class="justify">Core memories have a big advantage: They keep their
memory. For example, you can start a computer that was turned off 1975
with the programs that were saved at that time. There is no need for booting.
<br>Long time after the core memory's time the main memory from a computer
is still called "core" although long ago semiconductor memories are used.</p>
