<h3>Educational service at technikum29</h3>

<p>Robots always have been interesting for children and teenagers. We foster this
fascination to cultivate programming in a suitable way. As an alternative to
virtual turtles at computer screens, in our workshops students can deal with
physical objects. That's why we headline our workshops <strong>Physical Computing</strong>.
It's by definition the construction of systems which interact with the physical world.

<p>We also call this workshop <strong>Arduino lab</strong>. This is as we equip an
Arduino microcontroller with sensors and moving components. We work with the
<em>Arduino uno</em> and the <em>Arduino Mega</em> devices and program with
the Arduino dialect of C/C++. Previous knowledge is not needed.

<p>Workshops are structured by worksheets which contain tasks and partial
<em>sketches</em>. Sketches are small Arduino program which are very well
suitable to demonstrate basic programming principles.

It's astonishing how quickly robots seem to behave in an intelligent way.
Programming is fun and success guaranteed. We use our website to publish
scripts, worksheets and solutions for preparation and homework.

<p>With the <a href="robotics.php">Lego Robotics</a> workshop we gained quite
some experience in hosting workshops at technikum29. For pupils, it's always
great fun to find creative solutions to given problems. This tightens the
self-esteem. For the course, it's a natural source of internal differentiation.
Teamplaying and up to date research questions are secondary products of
participation in the course.
